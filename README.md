**gitspirit - commit to social**

gitspirit/about repository is the single place of documentation on concepts, processes and everything related to projects of the gitspirit community.

With gitspirit we aim to improve social practices in the way similar to how git improves development practices. The key problem that git solves, and which is also fundamental to any social interaction, is the ability to communicate and work effectively in a distributed environment, from different time zones and places, with as many peers as you want.
