**gitspirit - commit to social**

With gitspirit we aim to improve social practices in the way similar to how git improves development practices. The key problem that git solves, and which is also fundamental to any social interaction, is the ability to communicate and work effectively in a distributed environment, from different time zones and places, with as many peers as you want.

First group of our projects solves the recruitment problem in IT. It enables the employers to find good developers for FREE and developers to find good employers without spending time on the job market. More details:

gitspirit/about repository is the single place of documentation on concepts, processes and everything related to projects of the gitspirit community.

Each individual project in turn maintains its own documentation on development and usage.
